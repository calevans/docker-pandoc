# What it does

This project will take a Markdown formatted book project and create :

- HTML
- PDF
- EPUB
- MOBI (Kindle)

# Build

To build this container, I use the following in this repo's root.

```
$ docker build --force-rm --squash --tag calevans/buildbook ./
```

# Requirements
For this project to work, several requirements  must be met.

## Directories
The following directories are required to be present in the root directory.

- manuscript
- config
- pandoc *

  * The pandoc directory is optional. It holds a couple of specific pandoc templates. If the templates do not exist, the program will proceed without them.

## Files
The following files are required for the system to operate.

- `book.yaml`
All the info about the book that is necessary to create the various files but cannot be derived from the other files. This is divided into three sections, `variables`, `book` and `manuscript`Here is a sample:
    
```
---
variables:
  FINALNAMEROOT: life_badges_by_cal_evans
  VERSION: 1.0.2
  COVERGRAPHIC: cover.png
book:
  title:
    type: main
    text: Life Badges
  creator:
    role: author
    text: Cal Evans
  publisher:  E.I.C.C., Inc.
  rights: Â© 2017 E.I.C.C., Inc. All Rights Reserved
  language: en_US.UTF-8
manuscript:
  - foreword.md
  - intro.md
  - learn.md
  - humility.md
  - be_a_better_person.md
  - be_a_better_developer.md
  - create_something.md
  - help_someone.md
  - greatness.md
  - leadership.md
  - inspire.md
  - conclusion.md
  - 99.md  
...
```
`variables` is dumped into a file and sourced by the script. The variables at that point are available in the script.
`book` is dumped into `book.yaml` and is used in the creation of the epub file.
`manuscript` is a list of the files in the order they should appear. These are the file names as they appear in the `manuscript/` directory.

- `manuscript/title.md`
This is the title page of the book. It can be MD and include HTML. 


- `pandoc/toc.html`
**OPTIONAL** If you are familiar with pandoc and you want to control the text surrounding the table of contents that is generated for the PDF, you can place a file in the `pandoc` directory named `toc.html`. It is up to you to understand what can go in this file. Here is a sample:
```
<div class="pagebreak">
<h1>Table of Contents</h1>
$toc$
</div>
```

-- `pandoc/copyright.html`
**OPTIONAL** This is not a pandoc specific file, it is just the file that will be used as a template for your copyright page if it exists. If it exists, we will try to replace `<!--DATEPUBLISHED-->` and `<!--VERSION-->` if they exist. Use this file to put any boilerplate you want on the copyright page. 

The `variables` section will be processed and a files containing `KEY=VALUE` pairs will be created. This will then be sourced so that the values will be available to the script.

The `book` section is what is passed to the EPUB generator. It is parsed and created as a file in the working directory and included in the EBPUB generation process.


# Process
When the container is properly executed, it will run `./buildbook.sh`. This is the starting point. `./builbook.sh` will check to make sure that all necessary files are present. It will then generate the output in all three formats. 


## Linux/macOS
```
$ docker run --rm -v `$PWD`:/data buildbook
```

## Windows
```
docker run --rm -v %cd%:/data buildbook
```
